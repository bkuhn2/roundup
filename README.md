# Round Up

## Abstract

Round Up is a React application that curates a list of 'lifestyle' articles from the New York Times and provides more details about each article, as well as an external link to the article itself. It features a streamlined but user-friendly UI/UX that is responsive across all screen sizes and is designed for a user that wants to peruse the travel, sports and arts sections of the paper specifically. When a user opens the app, they will see a list of articles they can browse, and can filter by category if the want to browse a specific section. When the user clicks on an article in the list, they will see the article details and external link.

This app uses the [NYT Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview).

## Context
This app was created as an assignment for the Turing School of Software & Design. It simulates a 'take-home' challenge that an applicant might receive as a part of the interview process in job hunting and was created in an 8 hour sprint.

## Planning
A Miro board was utilized to draw wireframes, brainstorm features, plan out the component list and state, and the site navigation among other things. A GitHub project board was also utilized to create issue 'tickets' that were comprised of user stories and used to monitor progress of the app as each feature was complete.

## Project Goals
- Time management
- Project planning
- Concise MVP and features (decision making)
- Being able to present and explain choices

## Insights
- Difficult at firsts to keep scope small and keep work within the 8 hour limit, but forced me to make choices and improved planning and decision making.
- API offered limited data, affected how the project was built (state, navigation), presented good opportunities for problem solving.
- Good practice using existing code skill set (React fundamentals, hooks, et cetera).
